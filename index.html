<h2>Description</h2>
<p>UnBlock Me 3D is a replication of the mobile game UnBlock Me. The premise of the game is to make a clear path for the red block to reach the transparent green wall. Teleport to view the puzzle in various angles, slide the obstacles with minimal movement, and vibe to the serene background music!</p>
<br>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Use the joystick to select a location to teleport. The user will teleport upon release. Use the grab grip button to see the pointer. When the pointer is pointing at an object that can be moved, use the grab pinch button to move that object.</p>
